### Objective
Cloud engineering involves designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and applications that run on cloud computing platforms. As an entry-level cloud engineer, it's essential to gain hands-on experience with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Here are five projects that I'm going to showcase my cloud engineering skills:

1. Deploy a web application on AWS EC2: Create a simple web application, such as a blog or a personal website, and deploy it on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. Configure security groups, IAM roles, and SSH access to the instance.

2. Set up a cloud-based data storage solution: Use AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage to set up a cloud-based data storage solution. Create buckets/containers and configure access control to allow only authorized users to access data.

3. Configure a load balancer on GCP: Create a simple web application and deploy it on a GCP instance group. Configure a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.

4. Create an automated backup solution: Use AWS Backup or Azure Backup to create an automated backup solution for cloud-based resources, such as EC2 instances or virtual machines. Set up backup schedules, retention policies, and disaster recovery plans.

5. Set up a serverless computing environment: Use AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to create a serverless computing environment. Develop a simple function that performs a specific task and triggers it using an event source. Monitor the function's performance and troubleshoot any issues.
